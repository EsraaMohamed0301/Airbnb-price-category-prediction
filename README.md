One of the biggest problems when people prepare to post a new listing on airbnb is, how much should one ask for? Of course the most intuitive way is to check how other similar postings price their apartment/house. So in this project, we are going to predict the listing price based on the listing characteristics 🔥🔥, in this way to optimize user experience and lower the bar to be a new host😍 !
